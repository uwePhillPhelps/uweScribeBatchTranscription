Scribe Batch Transcription

What is it?
This is an application (written in applescript) as part of the UWE transcription project. It is designed to process segments of a larger audio file - aiding transcription of audio using speech recognition software from MacSpeech called 'Scribe'. 

It's main function is to automate the following tasks:

	* configuring the OSX audio system
		to transmit audio to a networked client
		or to replay locally using attached speakers
	* launching MacSpeech Scribe
	* scanning a working directory for untranscribed audio segments
	* configuring Scribe to transcribe each audio segment
	* co-operating with a user, allowing transcript corrections
	* launching QuicktimePlayer to hear audio segments
	* configuring Scribe to update voice profiles based on corrections

Requirements
The application should work on any Macintosh (PPC or Intel) running OSX 10.4.x. It was written on OSX 10.6.2.

The application foolishly assumes several very specific things about the server (username ppad, Screen Sharing enabled, apple file sharing enabled, apache server with php running with ServerRoot in /Volumes/FAT32/Apache/, etc)

The application depends on Applescript for scripting,
also SystemEvents and accessibility for assistive devices for simulating user interaction,
also /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app for remote control of the server,
also Cycling74 SoundFlower, /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component and /System/Developer/Applications/Audio/Audio Lab.app for remote transport of audio to networked clients,
also MacSpeech Scribe for speech recognition and transcription,
